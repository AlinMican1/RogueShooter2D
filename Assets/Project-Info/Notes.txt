-Achieved performance by destroying game objects after some time



-Working on Pathfinding Algorithm 17th - 30th oct
- First Create a Grid system where we can get map out the whole map, also find all the non-walkable nodes.
       -To achieve make a gameobject and make a class Grid and set the gameobject at coordinate (0,0). 
       -Use a 2D array to implement the grid
       -Use a mask layer to find all the walkable and non-walkable nodes.
       -Testing I will be debug.logging to see the grid take shape.

-Second Create A* algorithm
