-Achieved performance by destroying game objects after some time

-Working on player movement and shoot script 3rd oct
 -Instantiate bullet at correct weapon muzzle coordinates
 -Allow player to move in y and x axis directions
 -Make a dodge function that gives the character invulnerability and not being able to spam the ability e.g adding a cooldown.
 -Take the left mouse button as an input to be able to shoot and 'WASD' keys to move characters.
 -Rotate character based on mouse location.

-Working on finding a good path finding algorithm week 10th Oct
 -Research Dijkstra' algorithm
 -Research A* path finding algorithm
 -Devise the advantages and disadvantages of each of them
 

-Working on Pathfinding Algorithm 17th - 30th oct
- First Create a Grid system where we can get map out the whole map, also find all the non-walkable nodes.
       -To achieve make a gameobject and make a class Grid and set the gameobject at coordinate (0,0). 
       -Use a 2D array to implement the grid
       -Use a mask layer to find all the walkable and non-walkable nodes.
       -Testing I will be debug.logging to see the grid take shape.

-Second Create A* algorithm


-Working on Health System week 31 oct
   -Able to take damage
   -Able to increase health
   -Bar health slider included

-Working on XP System week 31 oct
    -Learn about time scale in unity, being able to stop time and all functions (pausing the game) when activating time.time = 0 freezing everything that uses time scale.
    -Drop Xp when enemy is destroyed.

-Working on Recoil system week 7th Nov
    -Able to get player position and mouse crosshair position relative to the player.
    -Based on how far the mouse crosshair position is from player position increase recoil.
    -Use pythagoras theorem to work the distance between player and mouse crosshair position.
