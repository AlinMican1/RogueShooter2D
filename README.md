OBJECTIVE


The objective of the game is to endlessly survive a horde of approaching zombies, leveling up and gaining the opportunity to use new weapons and different mechanics. The longer the player survives they are rewarded with a multiplier bonus at the end based on how much “gold” (the currency of the game) they have collected. This allows them to further buy in the store different items.


There are several power ups, such as different weapons with different attributes, different types of bullets such as bouncy bullets to further assist the player in the game as rounds become harder to fend off.


CONTROLS
"WASD" - Movement
"Mouse1" - to shoot
"R" - to reload
SAVE GAME

If the player wants to save their data, they need to finish the game first, which ultimately leads to them being eliminated by the enemies. Once the player has been eliminated a Game over screen is displayed, informing the user how much “gold” they have collected and how long they have survived, this information is then saved.
